    <h2>The United States vs. AI: Copyright Under Judicial Fire</h2>
    <div class="abstract-box">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> As the home of Big Tech, the United States presents a striking legal paradox. While
            federal law
            remains largely silent on AI, the courts and the Copyright Of ice have erected an impassable barrier: the
            human authorship requirement. Between rulings rejecting "machine-creators" and an avalanche of class
            actions contesting model training, the U.S. system has made Fair Use the cornerstone of the digital
            economy—potentially at the expense of the creators themselves.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I. The State of Black-Letter Law: Human Orthodoxy vs. Legislative Silence</h3>
    <p>U.S. Intellectual Property (IP) law is characterized by a conceptual rigidity that stands in stark contrast to
        the
        country’s technological flexibility. In the absence of specific AI legislation, a strict interpretation of
        founding
        texts prevails.</p>

    <h4>A. The categorical refusal of "Electronic Personhood"</h4>
    <p>While Title 17 of the U.S. Code (The Copyright Act) does not explicitly define an "author," the U.S. Copyright
        Office (USCO) and federal courts have filled this silence with an intangible doctrine: no human, no protection.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Copyright:</strong> The USCO systematically refuses to register works generated by a machine without
            human
            creative intervention (March 2023 Guidance). A purely algorithmic work falls into the public
            domain. If a human intervenes, they must disclose and disclaim the AI-generated portions to protect
            only their personal contribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Patents:</strong> Title 35 of the U.S. Code (The Patent Act) defines an inventor as an "individual,"
            a term the
            Federal Court of Appeals interpreted as referring exclusively to a natural person (Thaler v. Vidal,
            2022). Consequently, autonomous AI inventions are technically unpatentable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The Battle over Training Data (Inputs)</h4>
    <p>This is the primary point of friction. Unlike the EU, the U.S. lacks a sui generis right for databases (Feist,
        1991).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Fair Use Gamble:</strong> The training of models on protected works relies entirely on the legal
            defense
            of Fair Use. Lacking a legislative Text and Data Mining (TDM) exception, developers (OpenAI,
            Google) argue that the massive ingestion of works to create a "transformative" model is lawful.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Uncertainty:</strong> Because Fair Use is a fact-specific defense and not a bright-line rule,
            every use is a
            potential lawsuit. Non-original datasets are protected only by contract or trade secret law, leaving data
            creators vulnerable to massive scraping.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>II. Reform Projects and Political Trends: Legislative Hesitation</h3>
    <p>While Congress holds frequent hearings, no major federal legislation has emerged, leaving the floor to
        transparency initiatives.</p>

    <h4>A. Toward Mandatory Disclosure?</h4>
    <p>The most significant proposal is the Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act (H.R. 7913) of April 2024. This
        bill does not ban training but requires developers to file a notice listing the copyrighted works used in their
        datasets.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Goal:</strong> To create traceability, allowing authors to assert their rights without the
            legislature
            having to prematurely decide on the legality of the training itself.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. Reports and "Soft Law"</h4>
    <p>The USCO continues to issue prospective reports (2023–2025), notably suggesting federal protection for an
        individual's image and voice against "digital replicas" (deepfakes). However, on core issues like TDM
        exceptions, the administration is content to wait for the courts to clarify the application of Fair Use.</p>

    <h3>III. Current Litigation: Common Law in Action</h3>
    <p>The future of American AI is currently being written in the courtrooms. A series of historic trials is currently
        defining the boundaries of future law.</p>

    <h4>A. Confirming the Rejection of the AI-Author</h4>
    <p>The ruling in Thaler v. Perlmutter (D.C. Cir., March 2025) confirmed that an image generated autonomously by
        an AI ("A Recent Entrance to Paradise") cannot receive copyright. The court reminded the public that "human
        authorship is a bedrock requirement."</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Case to Watch:</strong> Allen v. Perlmutter (Colorado). This case tests the limits of "assisted"
            work.
            Artist Jason Allen, who used Midjourney with extensive iterations and post-processing for his
            award-winning "Théâtre D’opéra Spatial," is challenging the refusal to register his work. This case will
            determine the threshold of human intervention required for protection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The Class Actions: The Trials of the Century?</h4>
    <p>Courts are seized by multiple class actions brought by artists and authors against AI giants.
        1. Andersen v. Stability AI (California): The court allowed the infringement claim to proceed, finding it
        plausible that models contain compressed copies of training works.
        2. Tremblay v. OpenAI: Authors (including Sarah Silverman) are suing over the "ingestion" of their
        books. While secondary infringement claims were dismissed for lack of "substantial similarity" in the
        outputs, the direct infringement (the act of training) remains the heart of the debate.
        3. Doe v. GitHub: This litigation raises the novel question of AI compliance with Open Source licenses.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>U.S. law is currently in a phase of "creative turbulence." By refusing to legislate hastily, the United States
        has
        tasked its judges with the Herculean effort of adapting 20th-century copyright law to the realities of
        generative
        AI. If the door remains closed to machine-authored works, the outcome of the Fair Use trials will determine
        whether America remains a "data paradise" for developers or shifts toward a mandatory licensing model.</p>
