    <h2>AI Regulation under EU Law: From Humanist Dogma to the Pragmatic Shift of the "Digital Omnibus"</h2>

    <div class="abstract-box">
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> While the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (the “AI Act”) laid the
            foundations for European regulation, late
            2025 marks a strategic rupture. With the presentation of the “Digital Omnibus” package on 19 November 2025,
            the
            European Commission has executed a spectacular course correction: the postponement of deadlines, the
            consecration of legitimate interest for model training, and administrative simplification. This article
            analyses
            how this new economic pragmatism collides with the principles of intellectual property and data protection,
            redefining the balance between regulation and innovation.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I. The State of Positive Law: The Persistence of the Intellectual Property Deadlock</h3>
    <p>Despite recent regulatory relaxations, the bedrock of intellectual property law remains, for the time being,
        hermetically sealed against claims of “machine creativity”.</p>

    <h4>A. The Stubborn Refusal of Creativity Without an Author</h4>
    <p>Europe maintains a firm anthropocentric stance: intellectual property remains a reward for the human spirit.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Copyright and Originality:</strong> Case law remains unanimous. For a work to be protected, it must
            reflect the “stamp of the author’s personality” (<em>Painer</em> case law). Creations generated autonomously
            by an AI fall, by default, into the public domain.</li>
        <li><strong>Practical Nuance:</strong> Assistance is tolerated, but autonomous generation disqualifies the work.
            The boundary between the two remains the new evidentiary battleground.</li>
        <li><strong>The Patent Dead End (The DABUS Case):</strong> The European Patent Convention (EPC) and national
            case law (notably the German Federal Court of Justice, BGH, in June 2024) confirm that only a human being
            can be designated as an inventor. AI generating technical solutions remains, legally speaking, a machine
            without rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The AI Act vs. The "Digital Omnibus": Loosening the Grip</h4>
    <p>The AI Act (2024) imposed strict obligations, particularly under Article 53 regarding General Purpose AI (GPAI)
        models concerning copyright policy and data transparency. However, the “Digital Omnibus” presented in November
        2025 fundamentally disrupts the timeline and rigour of these obligations to provide breathing room for the
        industry.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Strategic Postponement of Application:</strong> The entry into application of rules for
            High-Risk AI Systems (HRAIS) is no longer fixed to a rigid date. It is now conditional upon the availability
            of harmonised technical standards (a “Stop-the-Clock” mechanism), pushing potential deadlines back to
            December 2027 (Annex III) or even December 2028 (Annex I).</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency and Penalties:</strong> The enforcement of penalties regarding transparency obligations
            (crucial for copyright holders) is deferred to 2 February 2027 for general-purpose AI systems placed on the
            market before August 2026.</li>
        <li><strong>Administrative Simplification:</strong> The registration obligation for systems benefiting from an
            exception (Art. 6(3)) is abolished, transforming an ex ante control regime into one of ex post liability.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>II. The Data Revolution: Legitimate Interest as the Engine for Training</h3>
    <p>It is in the field of access to training data (Input) that the “Digital Omnibus” operates its most radical
        revolution, altering the equilibrium with the GDPR to favour AI.</p>

    <h4>A. Lifting GDPR Barriers for Training</h4>
    <p>Until now, training models on personal data faced uncertainty regarding the lawful basis. The new text cuts the
        Gordian knot:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consecration of Legitimate Interest (Art. 88c):</strong> The development and testing of AI
            (including Large Language Models and generative models) are now explicitly recognised as falling under the
            legitimate interest of the controller.</li>
        <li><strong>Major Impact:</strong> This de facto exempts developers from obtaining user consent for training,
            removing a major industrial obstacle.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensitive and “Residual” Data:</strong> A new derogation (Art. 9(2)(k)) permits the processing of
            special categories of data (health, political opinions) without consent if they are “residual” (not
            necessary for the purpose) during training, subject to protective measures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The Persistence of Tension over Copyright (TDM)</h4>
    <p>While the “Personal Data” lock has been picked by the Omnibus, the “Intellectual Property” lock remains fast.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Retention of the Opt-out:</strong> The Text and Data Mining (TDM) exception under Directive (EU)
            2019/790 remains the standard. Mining is free unless there is an express reservation of rights (“opt-out”)
            by the rightholders.</li>
        <li><strong>The New Articulation:</strong> The European AI economy now rests on a dual regime: quasi-total
            freedom regarding personal data (thanks to the legitimate interest provisions of the new Omnibus), but
            supervised liberty regarding copyright (still subject to respect for the opt-out).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>C. The Consolidation of Industrial Data</h4>
    <p>The “Digital Omnibus” clears the “legislative patchwork” by merging scattered texts (Free-Flow, Open Data, Data
        Governance Act) into the Data Act. The stated objective is sovereignty and the securing of trade secrets,
        creating a safer environment for the exploitation of non-personal industrial data.</p>

    <h3>III. The Courtroom as Laboratory: The Era of Litigation (2023-2026)</h3>
    <p>Despite legislative relaxations, the courts remain the ultimate arbiter, particularly regarding the application
        of intellectual property rules which the Omnibus does not alter.</p>

    <h4>A. The Battle for Training: "Fair Use" vs. "Opt-out"</h4>
    <p>The litigation of SNE/SGDL v. Meta (France, March 2025) remains a burning issue.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Omnibus Impact:</strong> While Meta may now more easily invoke legitimate interest for the
            “personal data” aspect of training, the core of the dispute remains the use of protected books (the “Books3”
            dataset). Does the TDM exception (Art. 4) cover the use of illicit sources? The Omnibus does not answer this
            question of pure intellectual property, leaving the French judge alone to interpret the Copyright Directive.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. Regulatory Sandboxes and Litigation</h4>
    <p>The new Article 57, revised by the Omnibus, creates a European regulatory sandbox managed by the AI Office
        starting in 2028.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Litigation Consequence:</strong> This could shift a portion of conflicts from the courts to these
            supervised testing spaces, allowing SMCs (Small Mid-Cap Enterprises, a new category favoured by the text )
            to validate their compliance upstream, thereby reducing the risk of subsequent litigation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion: Towards "Data-Driven" Competitiveness</h3>
    <p>With the “Digital Omnibus” package of December 2025, the European Union is attempting a bold gamble: responding
        to the technological lag with a shock of simplification. By delaying the most burdensome obligations of the AI
        Act and “subjectivising” the notion of personal data, Brussels is signalling to the markets that the priority
        for 2025–2030 will be competitiveness.</p>
    <p>However, this shift leaves the fortress of copyright intact. The coming years will therefore witness increasing
        friction between liberalised access to personal data and intellectual property rights which, via the opt-out
        mechanism, remain the last bastion of creators in the face of automation.</p>
