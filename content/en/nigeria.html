    <h2>Nigeria Confronting the Challenge of Artificial Intelligence: Between Legal Orthodoxy and Strategic Ambitions
    </h2>

    <div class="abstract-box">
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> As Africa’s demographic and cultural giant, Nigeria has an intellectual property
            framework recently modernised by
            the Copyright Act 2022. Yet this statute remains silent on artificial intelligence, entrenching a resolutely
            anthropocentric approach that excludes autonomous creations. Between the lack of a Text and Data Mining
            (TDM)
            exception and the emergence of ambitious bills, this article analyses a legal system at a crossroads, where
            the
            dynamism of the creative scene (Nollywood, Afrobeats) may drive the emergence of novel case law.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I. State of Positive Law (law in force): The Bulwark of Legal Humanism</h3>
    <p>Nigerian positive law is marked by a misleading modernity. While the Copyright Act 2022 (in force since March
        2023) reformed copyright law, it maintained—indeed reinforced—the dogma of human creation, leaving AI in a legal
        grey zone both as to ownership (outputs) and as to access to data (inputs).</p>

    <h4>A. The categorical refusal of “electronic personhood” (a debated concept of granting legal personality to AI
        systems)</h4>
    <p>Nigerian law makes human intervention a condition <em>sine qua non</em> for intellectual property protection.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Copyright:</strong> The 2022 Act recognises authorship only for “persons” (natural persons or legal
            persons representing humans). The requirement of originality resulting from a human intellectual effort
            (Section 2(2) of the Copyright Act) <em>de facto</em> excludes works generated autonomously by AI. Unlike
            the United Kingdom, which grants protection to “computer-generated works”, Nigeria provides no status for a
            “bionic entity”.</li>
        <li><strong>Patents:</strong> The Patents and Designs Act 1971, though ageing, points in the same direction. The
            statutory inventor is defined as a “person”, terminology which—combined with the obligation to state name
            and address—disqualifies DABUS-type AI systems.</li>
        <li><strong>The software grey zone:</strong> While software (and therefore AI source code) is protected as a
            literary work, abstract algorithms and mathematical methods remain excluded from patentability, absent a
            concrete technical application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The absence of regulation for training data (Inputs)</h4>
    <p>This is arguably the most critical gap for the AI industry. Nigeria has neither an EU-style <em>sui generis</em>
        database right (a specific statutory right protecting a database maker’s substantial investment) nor a Text and
        Data Mining (TDM) exception.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal uncertainty for Machine Learning:</strong> In the absence of broad fair use or a specific
            exception, training models on protected works can, in principle, constitute copyright infringement.</li>
        <li><strong>Protection of databases:</strong> Only databases whose structure is original are protected by
            copyright. Compilations of raw or factual data (Section 3 of the Copyright Act) fall outside proprietary
            protection, leaving dataset creators with little recourse beyond trade secret protection or contract.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>II. Reform Projects and Political Trends: Governance in the Making</h3>
    <p>Aware of the gap between positive law and technological reality, Nigeria is multiplying political and legislative
        initiatives, seeking to position itself as a regional leader in AI governance.</p>

    <h4>A. The legislative and strategic push</h4>
    <p>The year 2024 marked a turning point in political ownership of AI, even though IP-specific texts remain scarce.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Framework bills:</strong> The House of Representatives adopted at second reading, on 3 December
            2024, a consolidated bill (including the National AI and Robotic Sciences Bill) aimed at creating a
            regulatory Commission. While these texts target overall governance, they lay the foundations for an
            authority capable of issuing future standards on data.</li>
        <li><strong>National Strategy (NAIS):</strong> Led by NITDA, this strategy under development should address
            rights ownership and ethics, filling the gap left by current laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. Alignment with international diplomacy</h4>
    <p>Nigeria favours a multilateral approach, declining to legislate in isolation on the most complex IP issues.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Continental and global engagement:</strong> The country subscribed to the African Union’s
            Continental AI Strategy (June 2024) and to the Bletchley Park Declaration.</li>
        <li><strong>The NCC doctrine:</strong> The Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC), through its Director-General in
            November 2024, acknowledged the need to find a “win-win” balance (licensing, remuneration), not excluding a
            revision of international norms. It already has extensive investigative powers enabling it to audit training
            databases where an infringement is suspected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>III. Litigation Developments: The Calm Before the Storm</h3>
    <p>While Nigerian courts remain silent on AI, local artistic practice and older case law sketch the contours of
        future disputes.</p>

    <h4>A. Case law by analogy</h4>
    <p>No decision has yet determined the fate of an AI-generated work. However, the principles established in
        <em>Ifeanyi Okoyo v. Princess Printing (2005)</em> and <em>Yeni Anikulapo-Kuti (2014)</em>, which require
        “effort, skill and labour” from the author, leave little doubt: Nigerian judges would likely deny protection to
        a work lacking substantial human input.
    </p>

    <h4>B. Practical cases awaiting legal classification</h4>
    <p>The absence of proceedings does not mean the absence of conflicts. Nigeria’s music industry saw the release, in
        2023, of an Afrobeats album generated by AI, and the Nollywood sector is experimenting with automated dubbing.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Litigation risk:</strong> These practices place creators in a legal fog—an inability to protect
            their AI productions and a risk of being sued for infringement if the AI has “ingested” protected works.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Foreign influence:</strong> Nigerian lawyers are tracking Western cases (such as <em>Getty v.
                Stability AI</em> or <em>NYT v. OpenAI</em>). It is highly likely that the first local disputes will
            draw on arguments developed in those jurisdictions, in particular on how infringement might be proven
            through analysis of AI outputs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Nigeria stands at a pivotal stage. Its rigid, classical positive law offers an appearance of certainty but is
        ill-suited to the massive data flows of Machine Learning. By choosing, for now, the path of political strategy
        rather than a blunt reform of the intellectual property code, the Nigerian legislature is buying time for
        observation. Yet given the vitality of its cultural industries, that wait-and-see posture could quickly be
        overtaken by courtroom reality.</p>
