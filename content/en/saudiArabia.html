    <h2>Saudi Arabia and AI: Between Anthropocentric Rigor and Vision 2030 Ambition</h2>
    <div class="abstract-box">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Driven by the unprecedented technological transformation of Vision 2030, the
            Kingdom of Saudi
            Arabia is refining its legal arsenal. While the current framework remains anchored in a humanist conception
            of
            creation, the emergence of proactive "soft law" and a pioneering draft bill in the Middle East are sketching
            the
            outlines of a hybrid regime: one that protects human genius while resolutely incentivizing algorithmic
            innovation. Here is an analysis of a system in full mutation.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I. The State of Black-Letter Law: The Bulwark of Human Creativity</h3>
    <p>The current Saudi legal framework, primarily governed by the Copyright Law (2003) and the Patents Law
        (2004), rests on a classic postulate: intellectual property is the exclusive fruit of the human mind.</p>

    <h4>A. The refusal of machine legal personhood</h4>
    <p>In copyright law, Article 1 of Royal Decree No. M/41 is unequivocal: the author is "the person who created the
        work." This definition de jure excludes purely automated creations. The Saudi Authority for Intellectual
        Property (SAIP)guidelines issued in June 2025 crystallized this position: a production generated without
        human intervention falls into the public domain.
        However, the Kingdom acknowledges the validity of AI-assisted works. The determining criterion is the
        "sufficient contribution" of the human creator (prompt engineering, iterative editing), a necessary condition
        for
        the work to bear the stamp of the user's personality.
        Regarding patents, the rigor is identical. Between 2023 and 2025, the SAIP reaffirmed the anthropocentric
        nature of inventiveness. While AI is a powerful research tool, it cannot hold the status of an inventor. Any
        invention lacking significant human contribution to the inventive concept is, as it stands, unpatentable.</p>

    <h4>B. Software and algorithms: Protection by default</h4>
    <p>Saudi law assimilates software into "literary works," offering classic copyright protection to source code. In
        contrast, "pure" algorithms and mathematical methods remain outside the scope of private appropriation, unless
        they are integrated into an invention producing a concrete technical effect (a standard aligned with TRIPS
        agreements). Given the legislative silence on algorithms as distinct objects, economic actors are turning
        heavily
        toward the Trade Secrets Law to secure their proprietary models.</p>

    <h4>C. Indirect regulation of training data</h4>
    <p>Saudi Arabia does not possess a sui generis right for databases. The protection of datasets remains subordinate
        to the originality of their selection or arrangement. However, the regulation of training data saw a major
        advancement via the Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL), which came into full effect on September 14,
        2023. By regulating automated processing and algorithmic decisions, the PDPL imposes an ethical and legal
        filter on machine learning, turning privacy compliance into an indirect prerequisite for AI data exploitation.
    </p>

    <h3>II. Legislative Outlook: Toward Regional Leadership</h3>
    <p>Aware of the limits of its classic texts, the Kingdom unveiled a comprehensive draft IP law in 2023, whose
        chapter dedicated to AI could set a precedent in the region.</p>

    <h4>A. Enshrining the human contributor</h4>
    <p>The 2023 draft proposes to cut the Gordian knot of ownership: protection would be granted to any AI-derived
        creation, provided a natural person contributed to it. However, the text introduces a forfeiture clause: if the
        human contribution is deemed "insignificant," the creation falls into the public domain. This "significance"
        threshold is likely to trigger intense judicial debate in the coming years.</p>

    <h4>B. A policy of financial incentives</h4>
    <p>The originality of the Saudi project lies in its promotional aspect. Unlike the purely defensive approach of the
        European Union, the Kingdom is considering financial sponsorship measures for inventions based on
        advanced AI technologies and an accelerated examination procedure (fast-track) for patents in the sector.
        This strategy confirms that IP is perceived in Riyadh as a lever for technological sovereignty.</p>

    <h4>C. The power of "Soft Law"</h4>
    <p>While awaiting the promulgation of this law, authorities are saturating the regulatory space with directives:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Ethics Principles (SDAIA, Sept 2023):</strong> Mandate the traceability of training data.</li>
        <li><strong>Generative AI Guidelines (Jan 2024):</strong> Recommend watermarking content and ensuring equitable
            remuneration for rights holders whose works feed the models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>III. Current Litigation: The Awakening of the Courts</h3>
    <p>While jurisprudence was long absent, 2025 marked a turning point with a first landmark administrative decision.
    </p>

    <h4>A. Sanctioning AI-driven infringement (SAIP Decision, Sept 23, 2025)</h4>
    <p>In a pioneering case, the SAIP fined a user 9,000 SAR for modifying an original photograph via generative AI
        without consent.
        Analysis: The committee did not treat AI as a new paradigm but applied the classic theory of
        unauthorized derivative works. This decision confirms that AI is not a legal vacuum: it is a
        transformation tool whose illicit use is classified as outright infringement.</p>

    <h4>B. The DABUS saga at the Office stage</h4>
    <p>Saudi Arabia has also closed the DABUS chapter. Although the Office initially accepted the filing in 2020
        (formal stage), it ultimately rejected the application in 2022-2023 due to the lack of a human inventor. This
        rejection, now final, aligns the Kingdom with the USPTO and EPO, confirming the machine's inability to fulfill
        the "social contract" of a patent.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion: An Emerging Pragmatic Model</h3>
    <p>Saudi Arabia is adopting a posture of "vigilant transition." By maintaining the requirement for a human author
        while preparing a legislative framework that values AI investment, the Kingdom seeks a balance between legal
        certainty and economic attractiveness.
        The true challenge will lie in the practical application of the "significant human contribution" criterion. In
        the
        absence of exhaustive case law on data scraping, the Saudi system currently relies on self-regulation guided by
        omnipresent soft law. But with the decision of September 23, 2025, the SAIP has sent a clear signal:
        technological innovation will not come at the expense of classic copyright.</p>
