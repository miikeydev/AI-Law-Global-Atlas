    <h2>Artificial Intelligence in Turkey: Between Anthropocentric Orthodoxy and the Digital Pivot</h2>
    <div class="abstract-box">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> At the crossroads of persistent European legal influence and a drive for regulatory
            autonomy,
            Turkey is undergoing a phase of critical mutation. While its black-letter law remains anchored in a humanist
            conception of creation, the legislative offensive of December 2025 marks a turning point. Between
            maintaining
            the deadlock on "electronic personhood" and the bold introduction of "Fair Use," this is an analysis of a
            system
            attempting to regulate generative AI without sacrificing its creative ecosystem.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I. The State of Black-Letter Law: The Fortress of Human Creation</h3>
    <p>The current Turkish legal framework rests on a sedimentation of classic texts, Law No. 5846 on Intellectual
        and Artistic Works and Industrial Property Code No. 6769, which, through their silence on AI, impose a
        strictly anthropocentric interpretation.</p>

    <h4>A. The dogmatic exclusion of creative AI</h4>
    <p>In Turkey, copyright and patent law share a common root: the requirement of the human mind. Article 1 of Law
        No. 5846defines a work as a production bearing the "stamp of the personality" of its creator. This criterion,
        reaffirmed by the Court of Cassation on February 4, 2015 (TSE case), prohibits any recognition of ownership
        in favor of a legal entity or, by extension, a machine.
        As it stands, autonomous AI productions fall into a de facto public domain due to the lack of an identifiable
        author. The patent system follows this logic of alignment with the European Patent Convention (EPC): the
        inventor must be a natural person with legal capacity. If AI is merely an assisted instrument, the human
        researcher remains the sole legal subject. Much like the global DABUS saga, Turkey refuses to personify the
        algorithmic inventive act.</p>

    <h4>B. The hybrid model for database protection</h4>
    <p>Inspired by EU Directive 96/9/EC, Turkey offers dual protection for databases: copyright for the original
        structure and a sui generis right for substantial investment. The latter, lasting 15 years, constitutes the only
        operational bulwark against massive data extraction, though its implementation remains blurred in the absence
        of published precedents on Text and Data Mining (TDM).</p>

    <h3>II. Reform Projects and Political Trends: The 2025 Rupture</h3>
    <p>Faced with a regulatory vacuum, the Turkish legislator has engaged in a race against time, materialized by two
        major initiatives.</p>

    <h4>A. The Digital Copyright Bill (December 2025)</h4>
    <p>Introduced on December 11, 2025, the Dijital Telif Hakları (Digital Copyright) Bill is a frontal response to the
        challenges of generative AI. This text proposes an unprecedented techno-legal architecture:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A Supervisory Authority:</strong> The creation of the Telif Hakkı İzleme Kurumu (Copyright
            Monitoring
            Authority), a regulatory body with rapid decision-making powers.</li>
        <li><strong>Value Sharing:</strong> AI tools exploiting protected content must enter into equitable licenses and
            pay a
            portion of their revenue to rights holders, with potential penalties of up to 10% of turnover.</li>
        <li><strong>The Import of "Fair Use":</strong> For the first time, Turkey is considering integrating the
            Anglo-Saxon
            concept of Fair Use to cover transformative digital uses, offsetting the rigidity of current exceptions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. Toward horizontal regulation: The Framework Law (June 2024)</h4>
    <p>Parallel to this, the Framework Law on Artificial Intelligence (Yapay Zekâ Kanun Teklifi) aims for a
        risk-based approach modeled on the European AI Act. Although this text does not deal directly with IP, it
        imposes algorithmic transparency that could eventually force the disclosure of training sources (datasets), a
        major point of friction between tech companies and authors' unions.</p>

    <h3>III. Current Litigation: A Precarious Calm Before the Storm</h3>
    <p>While Turkish courtrooms have yet to render a landmark decision on creative AI, tension is rising within the
        legal and artistic communities.</p>

    <h4>A. From algorithmic liability to image rights</h4>
    <p>In the absence of "AI-Author" case law, practitioners rely on a 2020 Court of Cassation ruling which
        established that using an algorithm does not exempt the operator from liability in cases of automated
        infringement. This logic suggests increased severity toward generative AI platforms. Furthermore, the music
        sector is preparing detection protocols for "cloned voices," anticipating disputes regarding violation of the
        right
        to adaptation.</p>

    <h4>B. The threat of Class Actions</h4>
    <p>The current climate is marked by an October 2025 statement from the Writers' Union of Turkey, threatening to
        test the existing framework through injunctions against companies practicing unlicensed data scraping. Without
        an explicit TDM exception in the Civil Code, these actions could lead to systematic convictions for unlawful
        reproduction, placing AI developers in a state of chronic insecurity.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion: Toward Regulated Digital Sovereignty</h3>
    <p>Turkey refuses the status quo. By choosing to frame platforms and generative AI through transparency and
        remuneration obligations as of 2025, it is attempting to head off judicial conflicts. However, the introduction
        of
        Fair Use and the creation of a powerful administrative authority alter the balance of power. The challenge for
        the coming years will be to transform this legislative arsenal into an operational framework capable of
        protecting the "human touch" while allowing for the emergence of competitive national innovation.</p>
