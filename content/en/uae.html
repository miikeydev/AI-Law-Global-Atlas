    <h2>AI Ambition Confronting Legal Orthodoxy: An Analysis of the Intellectual Property Framework in the United Arab
        Emirates</h2>

    <div class="abstract-box">
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Committed to a major technological race through its “National AI Strategy 2031”,
            the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
            presents a fascinating legal paradox. Although the country modernised its entire body of intellectual
            property
            law in 2021, it chose not to legislate specifically on artificial intelligence. Between the absence of any
            status for machine-generated creations and reliance on trade secrecy to protect algorithms, this is an
            analysis
            of a legal regime that—for the time being—favours a “wait and see” pragmatism and contractual mechanisms.

    </div>

    <h3>I. The State of Positive Law: Strict Legal Humanism</h3>
    <p>The Emirati legislative framework, overhauled in 2021 through Federal Decree-Laws No. 38 (Copyright), No. 36
        (Trademarks) and No. 11 (Industrial Property), is strikingly silent on AI. This silence does not mean an absence
        of rules; rather, it requires the application of rigorous classical principles that, <em>de facto</em>, exclude
        AI from the category of rights-holders.</p>

    <h4>A. The legal personality lock</h4>
    <p>Emirati copyright law is firmly anthropocentric. Federal Decree-Law No. 38 of 2021 defines the author as “the
        person who creates the work”. Although the term “person” may include legal persons (corporate entities), most
        commentary agrees that initial creation still requires human involvement.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Exclusion of autonomous works:</strong> AI, lacking legal personality, cannot qualify as an author.
            Consequently, a work generated without substantial human intervention (without a “human touch”) fails to
            meet the originality requirement and will likely fall into the public domain. Emirati law has no corrective
            mechanism comparable to the UK’s copyright regime for “computer-generated works” (a statutory fiction
            attributing authorship to a human in certain cases).</li>
        <li><strong>The mismatch of moral rights:</strong> The very structure of economic rights (life of the author +
            50 years) and moral rights (perpetual and imprescriptible—i.e., not subject to limitation periods) confirms
            the impossibility of applying the current regime to a machine.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. Patents and the exclusion of software</h4>
    <p>In industrial property, Federal Law No. 11 of 2021 maintains a classic barrier: the exclusion from patentability
        of software “as such” (Article 7(d)).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consequence for AI:</strong> Algorithms and AI models, being essentially software- or
            mathematics-based, are not patentable per se. Only a technical invention incorporating AI may qualify for
            protection, provided that an inventive step can be shown.</li>
        <li><strong>The “ghost inventor”:</strong> The Emirati patent office, aligned with international practice,
            requires the designation of a human inventor. No AI has ever been recognised as an inventor in the UAE,
            leaving autonomously generated inventions in a legal grey area.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>II. Protecting “Inputs”: Secrecy Rather than Property</h3>
    <p>If AI creations (outputs) struggle to find protection, data and algorithms (inputs) sit between legal vacuum and
        indirect protection.</p>

    <h4>A. No sui generis right and no text-and-data-mining (TDM) exception</h4>
    <p>Unlike the European Union, the UAE does not recognise a <em>sui generis</em> database right (a standalone
        statutory right for database makers, separate from copyright).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Originality or nothing:</strong> A training database is protected by copyright only if its structure
            is original. Compilations of raw or purely factual data are excluded from IP protection.</li>
        <li><strong>The scraping risk:</strong> Emirati law provides no Text and Data Mining (TDM) exception. Training
            an AI on protected works without a licence therefore constitutes, in principle, copyright infringement.
            Existing exceptions (research, quotation) are too narrow to secure commercial machine learning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The trade secret refuge</h4>
    <p>In practice, protection of AI assets (algorithms, datasets, know-how) shifts toward criminal and civil law.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The secrecy toolkit:</strong> In the absence of a dedicated Trade Secrets Act, protection relies on
            the Penal Code (Arts. 379 and 432), the Civil Transactions Law (Art. 905) and labour law (Art. 44).
            Unauthorised disclosure of “secrets” by an employee or partner is severely sanctioned.</li>
        <li><strong>Contract primacy:</strong> The real protection of AI in the UAE is contractual (NDAs,
            confidentiality clauses). This is protection <em>de facto</em>, not <em>de jure</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>III. Forward Look and Litigation: The “Wait and See” Strategy</h3>
    <p>Despite an ambitious policy agenda (AI Strategy 2031), Emirati lawmakers and judges have shown notable caution.
    </p>

    <h4>A. A deliberate legislative “gap”?</h4>
    <p>No bill aimed at amending the IP framework for AI is currently under consideration. The government favours
        flexible tools:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sandboxes (RegLab):</strong> The regulatory lab allows technologies to be tested outside a strict
            legal framework, providing a safety valve for innovation without freezing the law.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethics before property:</strong> The only recent normative developments concern governance and
            personal data protection (Law No. 45 of 2021; DIFC Data Protection Amendment 2023 on autonomous systems),
            not intellectual property.</li>
        <li><strong>AI as lawmaker:</strong> Notably, the Emirates Intellectual Property Association announced in May
            2025 the use of AI to assist in drafting future laws—presented as a world first—which could accelerate
            forthcoming reforms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. Silence in the courts</h4>
    <p>To date, there is no published UAE case law dealing with AI-generated IP. No DABUS-type litigation, no disputes
        over copyright in algorithms.</p>
    <p>This judicial silence contrasts with the activity of international courts (USA, UK). However, the courts are
        preparing: in 2023, the DIFC Courts had to rule on the admissibility of AI-generated evidence, and the use of
        technological tools by judges themselves is becoming more widespread.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The United Arab Emirates is navigating by sight, but pragmatically. The law in force, through its orthodoxy,
        refuses to personify the machine, creating areas of uncertainty (training data, autonomous works). For now, the
        State seems to bet on the attractiveness of its free zones and the flexibility of its regulatory laboratories
        (RegLab), preferring to wait for an international consensus before enshrining in legislation a specific status
        for AI.</p>
