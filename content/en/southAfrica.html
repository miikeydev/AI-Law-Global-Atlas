    <h2>South Africa as an AI Legal Laboratory: Between Administrative Boldness and Legislative Uncertainty</h2>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>South Africa offers a compelling case study in the global landscape of artificial intelligence regulation. A
        pioneer by accident, it became the first country in the world to grant a patent to an AI system ("DABUS") in
        2021, even as the “Rainbow Nation” paradoxically operates under an ageing legislative framework. With a
        copyright reform stalled before the Constitutional Court and a national strategy still at draft stage, this
        analysis examines a legal system under strain—one in which administrative practice sometimes runs (dangerously)
        ahead of the law.</p>

    <h3>I. The State of Positive Law: A "Hybrid" Framework Tested by AI</h3>
    <p>South African law stands out for its pragmatic approach, rooted in the Common Law yet supplemented by specific
        statutory mechanisms which, although designed before the era of generative AI, provide surprisingly relevant
        answers to today’s challenges.</p>

    <h4>A. Early recognition of the "computer-generated" work</h4>
    <p>As early as 1992, the South African legislature amended the Copyright Act 1978 to introduce a forward-looking
        legal fiction. The author of a computer-generated work is defined as “the person who undertook the arrangements
        necessary for the creation.”</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Haupt case law (2006):</strong> The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) clarified this notion by
            distinguishing an “assisted” work (the computer is a tool) from a “generated” work (minimal human
            intervention). In the latter case, protection remains available, but ownership is attributed to the system
            designer or to the user who configured the tool.</li>
        <li><strong>The grey area of full autonomy:</strong> While the statute covers works where a human “arranges” the
            creation, it leaves in the shadows outputs produced by fully autonomous AI, without prompts or any
            meaningful human intervention. In the absence of an eligible author, such outputs risk falling into the
            public domain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The global anomaly of the DABUS patent</h4>
    <p>In patent law, South African legislation contains no explicit exclusion of a non-human inventor. Taking advantage
        of this silence—and of a registration-based system with purely formal examination (no substantive examination on
        the merits)—the patent office, the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC), granted in July 2021
        patent no. 2021/03242 designating the AI DABUS as inventor.</p>
    <p><strong>Critical analysis:</strong> This decision, unique worldwide, is better understood as a procedural
        accident than as a deliberate policy choice. It places South Africa at odds with international standards
        (notably in Europe and the United States), which require a human inventor. Without judicial validation, the
        patent remains extremely fragile.</p>

    <h4>C. Patchy protection for training data (Inputs)</h4>
    <p>The South African regime is particularly stringent for AI developers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No TDM exception:</strong> There is no statutory exception for text and data mining (TDM).</li>
        <li><strong>Restrictive fair dealing:</strong> Unlike US-style fair use, the existing exceptions (research,
            criticism) are closed and enumerated. Training a model on protected works therefore constitutes, under
            current law, a potential act of infringement.</li>
        <li><strong>No sui generis database right:</strong> Databases are protected only under ordinary copyright (if
            original) or via the law of unlawful competition (French: <em>concurrence déloyale</em> — a common-law
            delict that polices misappropriation). Investments in assembling non-original datasets do not benefit from
            any specific, dedicated protection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>II. Reform Projects and Political Trends: Modernisation in Check</h3>
    <p>Aware of these gaps, the South African legislature has attempted to modernise its legal toolkit, but it faces
        major constitutional obstacles.</p>

    <h4>A. The Copyright Amendment Bill: the promise of fair use</h4>
    <p>The copyright reform bill, in the works since 2017, is the keystone of future AI regulation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Introducing fair use:</strong> The bill proposes replacing rigid fair dealing with a US-inspired
            fair use clause (section 12A). According to experts, this flexibility could legalise AI training on
            protected data, provided the use is transformative.</li>
        <li><strong>Constitutional blockage:</strong> At the end of 2024, the President referred the bill to the
            Constitutional Court, effectively suspending its enactment. South Africa is therefore in a legislative
            deadlock: one foot in the future (the bill) and one foot in the past (the 1978 Act still in force).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. A still-programmatic national strategy</h4>
    <p>The Draft AI Policy Framework (published for consultation in October 2024) sketches a future governance model
        focused on ethics and data.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data governance:</strong> The document emphasises data sharing and the development of open
            infrastructures, but remains vague on the intellectual property status of models.</li>
        <li><strong>No “AI Act” on the horizon:</strong> While the draft mentions the possibility of future regulation,
            no specific bill on liability or ownership of algorithms is currently on the parliamentary agenda.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>III. Litigation Update: A Deceptive Calm</h3>
    <p>Although South African courts have not yet had to decide major disputes involving generative AI, the
        jurisprudential foundations are already in place.</p>

    <h4>A. The legacy of the 1990s–2000s</h4>
    <p>The decisions in <em>Payen Components (1995)</em> and <em>Haupt (2006)</em> form the backbone of the current
        doctrine. By validating protection for computer-generated works on condition of human intervention (even if
        merely technical), the Supreme Court of Appeal provided a robust—if dated—analytical framework.</p>

    <h4>B. Waiting for the “test case”</h4>
    <p>The South African legal community remains on active watch.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>On the DABUS patent:</strong> The validity of this patent has never been tested before a court. A
            nullity/revocation action would be a landmark case for African patent law.</li>
        <li><strong>On web scraping:</strong> In the absence of case law on data mining, practitioners watch foreign
            litigation (such as <em>HiQ v. LinkedIn</em> in the US) and apply, by analogy, unlawful-competition
            principles to protect databases from misappropriation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>South Africa is navigating a legal in-between. On the one hand, its permissive patent system and its 1978
        copyright statute offer unexpected pathways for AI. On the other hand, the lack of effective legislative
        modernisation (the Copyright Bill stalemate) and the absence of specific rules for training data create legal
        uncertainty for investors. The country is ready for the technological leap, but its law remains—for
        now—suspended pending the decision of constitutional judges.</p>
