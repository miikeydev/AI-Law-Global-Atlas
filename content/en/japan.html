    <h2>The “Machine Learning Paradise”? An Analysis of Japan’s Model for Regulating AI and Intellectual Property</h2>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>A pioneer in adapting its legislative framework to the Big Data era, Japan stood out as early as 2018 for a
        normatively bold move with few global equivalents, turning the archipelago into a sanctuary for AI training. Yet
        this “Machine Learning paradise” rests on a precarious balance: near-total freedom upstream (inputs) and a
        categorical refusal of downstream protection (outputs) for non-human creations. As the DABUS litigation has
        crystallised the courts’ position and cultural industries organise, Tokyo appears—in 2025—to be initiating a
        strategic regulatory pivot.</p>

    <h3>I. The State of Positive Law: Between Strict Anthropocentrism and Industrial Flexibility</h3>
    <p>Japanese positive law is marked by a radical dichotomy: rights-holding is hermetically closed to non-human
        entities, offset by a broad opening of access to data in the name of innovation.</p>

    <h4>A. The Human-Author Dogma and the Rejection of “Machine Works”</h4>
    <p>Japan’s legal orthodoxy is unequivocal. In copyright, protection presupposes an “expression of creative thoughts
        or sentiments.” This statutory definition <em>de facto</em> excludes productions autonomously generated by AI.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The absence of legal personality:</strong> AI, lacking legal personality, cannot qualify as an
            author. Accordingly, content generated without human creative intervention (e.g., through a simple prompt)
            falls, by default, into the public domain.</li>
        <li><strong>The tool nuance:</strong> where AI is used as an instrument serving a characterised human creative
            intention (retouching, choices among outputs, complex instructions), copyright may subsist—but only for the
            benefit of the human user.</li>
        <li><strong>Patents and the “inventor”:</strong> the Patent Act No. 121/1959 follows a similar logic. The
            Japanese term for inventor (<em>shimei</em>) linguistically and legally refers to a natural person.
            Autonomously generated AI inventions therefore currently occupy a grey zone: they are, as a practical
            matter, non-patentable absent a human inventor who can be designated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. Article 30-4: The World’s Most Permissive Exception?</h4>
    <p>Japan’s singularity lies in upstream uses—training data (input). The 2018 reform introduced Article 30-4 of the
        Copyright Act, creating a framework exceptionally favourable to AI developers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Default lawfulness:</strong> the provision authorises the use of protected works for Text and Data
            Mining (TDM) and machine learning, without rightsholders’ authorisation, including for commercial purposes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The “non-expressive” use criterion:</strong> the key condition is that the use does not aim to
            “enjoy the work in an appreciative manner” (i.e., not for aesthetic consumption). Analysing the information
            contained in a work in order to train an algorithm is therefore lawful.</li>
        <li><strong>International comparison:</strong> unlike the European Union (rightsholders’ opt-out) or the United
            States (the uncertainty of fair use), Japan offers near-total legal certainty at this stage, without a
            compensation requirement. The sole limit is that the use must not cause unjustified prejudice to the
            author’s interests (e.g., direct competition through “style cloning”).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>C. Data Protection: The Alternative to an EU-Style Sui Generis Database Right</h4>
    <p>Japan rejected the idea of an exclusive property right over databases (such as the EU <em>sui generis</em>
        database right—an autonomous statutory right that protects substantial investment). Instead, the legislature
        amended in 2018 the Unfair Competition Prevention Act to create a regime for “Shared Data with Limited Access”
        (a statutory category protecting non-public data shared within a limited circle).</p>
    <p>This mechanism protects technical or commercial data—non-public yet shared in restricted settings (consortia,
        B2B)—against fraudulent acquisition or misappropriation. It reflects a behaviour-based approach (sanctioning
        disloyal conduct) rather than a property-based approach (creating a monopoly).</p>

    <h3>II. Reform Projects and Political Trends: Toward Rebalancing?</h3>
    <p>The year 2025 marks a potential turning point. Growing pressure from creators and press publishers is pushing the
        government to reconsider its ultra-liberal stance.</p>

    <h4>A. Rising Pushback and the 2025 Strategic Plan</h4>
    <p>While Article 30-4 has appealed to the tech sector, it increasingly worries cultural industries.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Creators’ backlash:</strong> figures such as Senator and manga artist Ken Akamatsu and the Japan
            Newspaper Publishers & Editors Association (December 2024) call for safeguards: dataset transparency,
            opt-out mechanisms, and possibly remuneration.</li>
        <li><strong>Government response:</strong> the Intellectual Property Strategic Program 2025 (June 2025) has
            formally opened the project. The government is considering amending Article 30-4 or introducing new
            transparency obligations for AI developers.</li>
        <li><strong>Patents:</strong> the same 2025 Program mandates an expedited study on the status of the inventor,
            exploring avenues such as co-invention (including the developer or the data provider), while highlighting
            the risk of rights fragmentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. Regulation Through “Soft Law”</h4>
    <p>In parallel, Japan adopted in June 2023 (reinforced in May 2025) a law promoting AI R&D and deployment (a
        framework statute setting principles rather than direct penalties).</p>
    <p>This instrument does not impose direct sanctions but articulates principles of responsibility and transparency.
        It empowers the government to issue guidelines, favouring—at this stage—a flexible, collaborative approach over
        abrupt coercive legislation.</p>

    <h3>III. Litigation Developments: The Judge Confronting Legal Gaps and Statutory Clarity</h3>
    <p>Japan’s litigation landscape illustrates both the effectiveness and the limits of the current framework:
        principle-driven patent litigation and a striking silence in copyright.</p>

    <h4>A. The DABUS Case: The End of the “Robot Inventor” Illusion</h4>
    <p>Japan has had its own episode of the global DABUS saga (Stephen Thaler’s “inventive” AI).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Decisions:</strong> after refusal by the Patent Office, the Tokyo District Court (16 May 2024) and
            then the Intellectual Property High Court (January 2025) confirmed the refusal of the patent.</li>
        <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> the courts relied on a literal reading of the statute (the term <em>shimei</em>
            implies a natural person) and on systemic reasoning (AI lacks legal personality).</li>
        <li><strong>Significance:</strong> the High Court expressly referred the matter back to the legislature, stating
            that protection for autonomous inventions is a legislative policy choice—not the judiciary’s role.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The Deafening Silence in Copyright Case Law</h4>
    <p>Notably, no major dispute has erupted in Japan between artists and AI firms, unlike the United States (e.g.,
        Getty litigation; artists v. Stability AI).</p>
    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> this silence is not acceptance, but the direct consequence of Article 30-4’s clarity.
        Because the exception is so broad and explicit, rightsholders have virtually no legal basis to sue for
        infringement based on training acts. Even Studio Ghibli or manga publishers—although vocal in public debate—have
        not brought test cases, as the current positive law is unfavourable to them.</p>
    <p>Only marginal cases of “style appropriation” (generally not protected as such by copyright) or voice imitation
        (often settled informally, e.g., a virtual J-Pop idol in 2023) have emerged, without generating binding
        precedent.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Japan offers a compelling case study in anticipatory legislation. By securing AI training early, Tokyo avoided
        the legal uncertainty affecting much of the West. However, the absence of protection for “machine works” and
        growing discontent among human creators are forcing a rethink. The era of total deregulation is likely nearing
        its end, giving way to a phase of political and legislative rebalancing anticipated for 2025-2026.</p>
