    <h2>AI in South Korea: Between Anthropocentric Orthodoxy and the Regulatory Vanguard</h2>
    <div class="abstract-box">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> As a global technological laboratory, the Republic of Korea is undergoing a
            critical phase of legal
            mutation. While its black-letter law remains anchored in a humanist conception of creation and
            inventiveness,
            the passage of the AI Basic Act in late 2024 and the emergence of mass litigation against web giants mark a
            turning point. Between the refusal of the "machine-inventor" and the search for a framework for Text and
            Data
            Mining (TDM), this article analyzes the balancing strategy of a nation that refuses to personify AI while
            securing its industrial growth.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I. The State of Black-Letter Law: The Human Author Deadlock</h3>
    <p>The current Korean legal framework rests on a sedimentation of classic texts—primarily the Copyright Act and
        the Patent Act—whose interpretation by authorities, notably the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO)
        and the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST), reaffirms the exclusive centrality of the natural
        person.</p>

    <h4>A. The dogmatic exclusion of creative and inventive AI</h4>
    <p>In copyright law, the principle is immutable: Article 2(1) of the Act defines a work as a production "expressing
        human thoughts and emotions." This approach de jure excludes any original authorship for an AI. The
        Guidelines on Generative AI and Copyright (late 2023) confirm that purely automated productions fall into the
        public domain.
        However, the Land of the Morning Calm recognizes the validity of hybrid works. The criterion lies in
        "substantial" human contribution (artistic retouching, original selection). Protection is thus fragmentary: it
        covers only the segments derived from human creativity, leaving the rest rights-free.
        In industrial property, the rigor is identical. Article 33 of the Patent Act reserves the right to a patent to
        "the
        person who creates an invention." Since AI lacks autonomous legal reasoning capacity, it cannot be designated
        as an inventor. This line was fortified by administrative and judicial rulings (cf. the DABUS case below).</p>

    <h4>B. The Dual Model: Software and Databases</h4>
    <p>Korea distinguishes itself through sophisticated protection of digital assets:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Software:</strong> Classically protected as literary works, covering the source code of neural
            networks as long
            as it emanates from a human programmer.</li>
        <li><strong>Sui Generis Database Rights:</strong> Similar to the European Union, Korea has protected the "sweat
            of the
            brow" (substantial investment) since 2003. A producer can prohibit the extraction of substantial parts
            of their database, even if it lacks originality. This regime offers operational and robust protection for
            the data repositories essential to AI, independent of any creativity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>II. Reform Projects and Political Trends: Toward Mandatory Transparency</h3>
    <p>Aware of the obsolescence of certain principles in the face of Machine Learning, the Korean legislator has
        engaged in a race for legislative modernization.</p>

    <h4>A. The AI Basic Act of 2024: A Framework of Trust</h4>
    <p>Promulgated on December 27, 2024, for entry into force in January 2026, the Basic Act on AI serves as the
        founding act of national technological regulation. While horizontal in nature, it impacts intellectual property
        through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mandatory Labeling:</strong> All AI-generated content must be clearly marked to prevent the
            misappropriation of the value of human works.</li>
        <li><strong>Dataset Transparency:</strong> For "high-impact" AI (healthcare, finance, recruitment), operators
            must
            document and be prepared to explain algorithmic criteria and the origin of training data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The Text and Data Mining (TDM) Project</h4>
    <p>This is the primary point of friction. In the absence of a TDM exception in current law, model training relies on
        the blurred doctrine of Fair Use (Art. 35-3). A draft amendment to the Copyright Act, supported by the
        government in 2025, aims to establish an explicit exception to authorize automated information analysis, subject
        to lawful access. This project is at the heart of a tug-of-war between tech companies (BSA) and cultural
        industries, the latter demanding a right to remuneration rather than a free exception.</p>

    <h3>III. Current Litigation: The Moment of Judicial Truth</h3>
    <p>While legislation is slow to decide, the courts are now the theater for major confrontations that are shaping
        tomorrow's jurisprudence.</p>

    <h4>A. The DABUS Case: Confirming the "Human Wall"</h4>
    <p>The case of the AI designated as an inventor saw its decisive episodes before the Seoul High Court (May 16,
        2024). The judges not only rejected inventor status for DABUS but criticized the idea that a patent could be
        granted without human reasoning. An appeal to the Supreme Court (Case 2024Du45177), still pending in
        early 2026, is the final step in confirming this protective conservatism of human intelligence.</p>

    <h4>B. The Media Shock: Broadcasters vs. Naver</h4>
    <p>On January 13, 2025, a historic action was launched by broadcasting giants (KBS, MBC, SBS) against the
        portal Naver.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Subject:</strong> The unauthorized use of news articles to train HyperCLOVA X models.</li>
        <li><strong>The Stake:</strong> Plaintiffs invoke infringement and the Unfair Competition Prevention Act (UCPA),
            denouncing free-riding on their journalistic investments. This is the "test case" that will determine if,
            without a TDM exception, massive scraping is illicit in Korea.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>C. Publicity Rights and Deepfakes</h4>
    <p>The landscape is also marked by actor Kim Nam-gil’s complaint in October 2024 against the unauthorized use
        of his voice by an AI advertisement. This case, coupled with the rise of K-pop deepfakes, is pushing the
        Ministry of Culture to place Publicity Rights at the top of its legislative agenda for 2025.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion: A Law in Search of Balance</h3>
    <p>South Korea is adopting a posture of anticipatory pragmatism. By refusing to personify AI while
        strengthening investment protection (databases) and imposing strict transparency (AI Basic Act), Seoul seeks to
        become a sanctuary for responsible innovation. The true challenge of the coming months will lie in the outcome
        of the Naver litigation and the final arbitration on the TDM exception: can the country protect its creators
        without stifling its own technological champions?</p>
