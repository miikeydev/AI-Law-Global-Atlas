    <h2>Singapore and AI: A Pragmatic Bet Between Intellectual Property Orthodoxy and Training Flexibility</h2>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>A major technology hub in Asia, Singapore has developed a distinctive legal strategy in response to artificial
        intelligence. Rather than embracing a new proprietary right over data, the city-state maintains a strict
        orthodox position on entitlement to rights (no protection without a human author or inventor), while
        simultaneously opening the innovation “floodgates” through some of the world’s most permissive Text and Data
        Mining (TDM) exceptions for model training. This article analyses a subtle balance between a “hands-off
        approach” to AI-generated creation and pro-business interventionism on training data.</p>

    <h3>I. The State of Positive Law: A Two-Speed Regime</h3>
    <p>Singapore’s positive law (i.e., the law in force) is characterised by a striking dichotomy: classical rigidity as
        to the protection of outputs (AI-generated creations), and bold flexibility as to inputs (training data).</p>

    <h4>A. The refusal of AI legal personality and the human requirement</h4>
    <p>Unlike the United Kingdom, which—through section 9(3) of the CDPA (Copyright, Designs and Patents Act
        1988)—creates a legal fiction to protect computer-generated works, Singapore adheres to a strictly
        anthropocentric conception of copyright.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Exclusion of autonomous works:</strong> Case law is unequivocal. As early as the leading case
            <em>Asia Pacific Publishing v Pioneers & Leaders (2011)</em>, the Court of Appeal held that identifying a
            human author is a condition <em>sine qua non</em> of protection (i.e., an indispensable condition). In the
            absence of legislation equivalent to the UK model, works generated autonomously by AI (texts, images, music)
            fall into the public domain (meaning: they are not protected by copyright). Where AI is used merely as a
            tool (“AI-assisted”), protection remains possible, but the burden of proving a genuine human creative
            contribution lies with the claimant.</li>
        <li><strong>Patent orthodoxy:</strong> Singapore’s Patent Act confines inventorship to the “natural person who
            devised the inventive concept” (natural person = human being, as opposed to a company). The Intellectual
            Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) applies international standards (in the vein of the DABUS line of
            cases), refusing to designate an AI system as inventor. Even where an innovation is patentable, it can only
            be so for the benefit of humans or legal persons (companies), provided that a flesh-and-blood inventor is
            named.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The Text and Data Mining (TDM) exception: an aggressive innovation lever</h4>
    <p>It is in the area of model training that Singapore stands out most sharply. The Copyright Act 2021 introduced a
        particularly broad exception for computational data analysis.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scope of the exception:</strong> It permits copying and extracting data from protected works to
            which the user has “lawful access”. Notably, the exception expressly extends to commercial purposes,
            allowing businesses to train models without prior authorisation from rightsholders.</li>
        <li><strong>Mandatory character of the rule:</strong> The legislature has “hardened” the regime by making it
            mandatory: no contractual clause may restrict this exception. Accordingly, website terms and conditions
            purporting to prohibit scraping are ineffective where access is lawful, placing Singapore among the most
            machine-learning-friendly jurisdictions.</li>
        <li><strong>The database-law gap:</strong> Unlike the European Union, Singapore rejects a <em>sui generis</em>
            database right (a specific, standalone right protecting substantial investment in databases—an EU-only
            construct). In <em>Global Yellow Pages Ltd v Promedia (2017)</em>, the Court of Appeal confirmed the
            rejection of the “sweat of the brow” doctrine (i.e., labour alone does not justify protection). A database
            is protected by copyright only if its structure is original. Purely factual Big Data compilations, or
            automatically generated datasets, are therefore, by default, unprotected—subject to reliance on trade
            secrets (confidential information regimes) or contract.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>II. Reform Projects and Political Trends: The ‘Wait and See’ Doctrine</h3>
    <p>Singapore’s national AI strategy (2019) signals a commitment to supporting technology, but the legislature has
        adopted pragmatic caution, preferring observation to over-regulation.</p>

    <h4>A. Uncertainty over the status of AI-generated works</h4>
    <p>A lively doctrinal debate has emerged around recognising computer-generated works. In 2020, the Law Reform
        Committee of the Singapore Academy of Law (SAL) recommended adopting the UK model to fill the legal gap and
        encourage investment.</p>
    <p>However, the government rejected that approach in the 2021 reform, opting for a “hands-off approach”. The policy
        choice is clear: allow the courts to draw the boundary case-by-case and wait for an international consensus
        before legislating. As of 2025, no bill seeks to grant specific rights to AI-generated creations.</p>

    <h4>B. Forward-looking adjustments on training data</h4>
    <p>While creating new property rights is ruled out (the 2020 SAL report advising against a property right in raw
        data), the scope of the TDM exception remains the subject of intense debate.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2024 consultation:</strong> The Ministry of Law and IPOS opened a consultation on technological
            protection measures (TPMs/DRM). The issue is whether the TDM exception should allow the lawful circumvention
            of digital locks.</li>
        <li><strong>International pressure:</strong> Cultural industries (notably the Motion Picture Association) press
            for an opt-out mechanism, fearing Singapore could become a “data-mining haven” where global works are
            exploited without compensation. The government is thus at a crossroads: preserve its attractiveness for AI
            developers or offer stronger assurances to rightsholders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>III. Litigation Developments: Calm Before the Storm?</h3>
    <p>An examination of judicial activity reveals a paradox: while theoretical questions abound, AI-specific litigation
        remains almost non-existent.</p>

    <h4>A. The reach of landmark cases</h4>
    <p>Singaporean case law rests on two pillars that effectively lock in the current system:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Asia Pacific Publishing (2011):</strong> This foundational Court of Appeal decision entrenched the
            requirement of a human author. It operates as a preventive safeguard, likely discouraging attempts to claim
            rights in purely artificial outputs (e.g., Midjourney or DALL-E-type content) before local courts.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Yellow Pages (2017):</strong> By refusing to protect factual databases through copyright, the
            Court of Appeal confirmed that financial or technical investment alone does not create a monopoly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>B. The absence of mass litigation</h4>
    <p>Unlike the United States, Singapore does not (yet) face class actions by artists against AI generators.</p>
    <p><strong>Legal analysis:</strong> This judicial silence can be explained structurally by the robustness of the
        2021 TDM exception. Whereas US fair use is a case-by-case defence subject to judicial balancing, the Singaporean
        exception is a clear and broad rule of positive law. Rightsholders therefore have limited room to challenge
        model training on infringement grounds (copyright infringement), so long as access to the underlying data is
        lawful.</p>
    <p>However, commentators note a risk of cross-border disputes. Issues akin to “double actionability” (a
        conflict-of-laws test requiring the conduct to be actionable in both the forum and the place of the tort) could
        arise if a company exploits, in Singapore, data protected abroad while seeking shelter behind the more
        permissive local regime.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Singapore offers a fascinating legal laboratory. By refusing to personify AI or to create complex <em>sui
            generis</em> rights, the city-state prioritises legal certainty and contractual fluidity. If the human
        creator remains the only “sacred” subject of rights, the regulatory environment is deliberately designed to make
        the island a sanctuary for algorithm training—even at the cost of friction with traditional cultural industries.
