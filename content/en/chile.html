    <h2>Chile in the Age of AI: Between Anthropocentric Orthodoxy and Legislative Boldness</h2>
    <div class="abstract-box">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A land of innovation in Latin America, Chile currently finds itself at a legal
            crossroads. While its
            black-letter law remains firmly anchored in a humanist conception of intellectual property, de facto
            excluding
            algorithmic creations, the legislator took the initiative in 2024 with an ambitious bill. Between the
            introduction
            of a Text and Data Mining (TDM) exception and transparency requirements, Santiago is attempting to carve
            out a "third way": a regulation that secures model training without overturning the dogma of the human
            author.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I. The State of Black-Letter Law: The Human Author Fortress vs. the Data Vacuum</h3>
    <p>The current Chilean legal framework is characterized by a striking dichotomy: rigid clarity regarding ownership
        (outputs) and a risky, artistic blur regarding data exploitation (inputs).</p>

    <h4>A. The categorical refusal of artificial creativity</h4>
    <p>Chilean intellectual property law is built around an unshakeable paradigm: anthropocentrism.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Copyright:</strong> Law No. 17.336 (1970) and the Constitution reserve the status of "author" to the
            "natural
            person who creates." In the absence of a provision comparable to the UK Copyright Act, any work
            autonomously generated by an AI falls, by default, into the public domain. The lack of human creative
            contribution disqualifies the object from any protection, creating a legal "no-man's land" for purely
            algorithmic productions.</li>
        <li><strong>Patents:</strong> Law No. 19.039 on Industrial Property follows the same logic. Although the text
            does not
            explicitly exclude AI, administrative practice and international consensus (e.g., the DABUS case)
            mandate the designation of a human inventor. AI remains a tool, never a legal subject.</li>
        <li><strong>Trademarks:</strong> Only trademark law escapes this rigor, focusing on the distinctiveness of the
            sign rather
            than its creative origin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The legal insecurity of model training</h4>
    <p>The real friction occurs upstream of creation. Unlike the European Union, Chile possesses neither a sui generis
        right for non-original databases nor a Text and Data Mining (TDM) exception.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The risk of mass infringement:</strong> Without an American-style Fair Use doctrine or a TDM
            exception,
            the massive ingestion of protected works to train models theoretically constitutes multiple copyright
            violations (reproduction and adaptation).</li>
        <li><strong>Economic vulnerability:</strong> Investments in the constitution of raw datasets do not benefit from
            specific
            proprietary protection. This leaves data producers defenseless against scraping, unless they resort to
            trade secrets or unfair competition law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>II. Reform Projects and Political Trends: Towards a Chilean "AI Act"?</h3>
    <p>Aware of these gaps, the government introduced Bill No. 16821-19 on May 7, 2024, marking a desire for
        pragmatic disruption.</p>

    <h4>A. The revolution of the TDM exception</h4>
    <p>The flagship measure of the bill lies in an amendment to Article 71 of the Copyright Law. This text would
        introduce a legal TDM exception allowing the use of protected works for automated analysis, provided there is
        lawful access.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scope and Limits:</strong> While this measure aims to provide a "safe harbor" for AI developers, it
            is
            conditioned on the absence of disguised exploitation of the works. However, the text remains
            vague on the boundary between commercial and non-commercial use and—crucially—does not
            seem to provide an opt-out mechanism for authors, unlike the European directive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. Transparency and the status quo on authorship</h4>
    <p>The bill imposes a transparency obligation on AI providers, forcing them to disclose the datasets used. This
        measure aims to rebalance the scales by allowing rights holders to verify the use of their works. Conversely,
        the legislator refuses to touch the definition of the "author." The bill creates no new rights for AI creations,
        confirming the anthropocentric approach. Chile is choosing to regulate the tool (transparency, security) and the
        raw material (data) without personifying the machine.</p>

    <h3>III. Current Litigation: Watching the Global Battles</h3>
    <p>For now, silence reigns in Chilean courtrooms, but it is a "vigilant silence," fueled by the observation of
        foreign
        jurisprudence.</p>

    <h4>A. Absence of domestic case law</h4>
    <p>To date, no Chilean court has ruled on a dispute involving AI authorship or the legality of scraping. This
        jurisprudential void leaves stakeholders in an uncertainty that only the passage of the 2024 Bill can resolve.
    </p>

    <h4>B. The normative influence of foreign precedents</h4>
    <p>The Chilean legal system does not exist in isolation. Practitioners are integrating lessons from major
        international decisions:
        1. Refusal of protection (USA/UK): Cases like Thaler v. Perlmutter (USA) and DABUS (UK) reinforce
        the Chilean position of denying copyright or patent status to AI.
        2. Data litigation risks: US class actions (authors against OpenAI/Meta) and the Getty Images v. Stability
        AI case act as deterrents. The Chilean bill, with its TDM exception, appears as a legislative attempt to
        preemptively defuse the kind of mass litigation currently threatening the AI industry.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Chile is adopting a strategy of "conservative modernization." By preserving the central figure of the human
        author while opening the data floodgates through a legislative exception, Santiago seeks to become a sanctuary
        of legal certainty for innovation in Latin America. It remains to be seen whether the absence of an opt-out
        right
        for authors will eventually create major political friction with the cultural sector.</p>
