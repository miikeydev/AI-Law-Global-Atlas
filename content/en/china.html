    <h2>China and AI: Judicial Pragmatism as the Engine of Intellectual Property</h2>

    <div class="abstract-box">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Rather than simply absorbing the shock of the AI revolution, China is pursuing an
            assertive legal strategy. While
            lawmakers are laying the groundwork for a flagship AI statute, the courts have moved first—crafting an
            audacious
            body of case law. Between recognising copyright in AI-generated images and tightening obligations on model
            and
            platform providers, China is testing a system designed to reconcile the protection of creators with national
            technological ambition.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I. The Law as It Stands: Legislative Orthodoxy, Judicial Boldness</h3>
    <p>China’s legal framework reveals a striking duality: conventional statutes that do not explicitly address AI, and
        a judiciary willing to engage with it to fill the gaps.</p>

    <h4>A. The Human-Author Requirement</h4>
    <p>At the legislative level, China remains broadly aligned with international orthodoxy. The Copyright Law (2020)
        and patent legislation continue to presuppose human intervention.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Patents:</strong> The national office (CNIPA) has firmly rejected applications naming the AI system
            DABUS as inventor (decision of 29 December 2023), reiterating that only subjects recognised under civil law
            can hold inventor’s rights. The 2024 Examination Guidelines confirm this exclusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Copyright:</strong> The statute provides no protection for works created autonomously. Yet case law
            has introduced a crucial nuance: the emerging recognition of “AI-assisted works”.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The Case-Law Turn: Creative Investment as the Test</h4>
    <p>In contrast to the more rigid stance associated with the US Copyright Office, Chinese judges have taken a
        pragmatic approach as early as 2019.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dreamwriter (2019):</strong> The Shenzhen court recognised protection for a finance article
            generated by AI, on the basis that Tencent’s teams had made a creative intellectual contribution through
            configuring the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Li v Liu (2023):</strong> The Beijing Internet Court made headlines by granting copyright protection
            for an image generated using Stable Diffusion. The judge emphasised that roughly 150 prompt iterations and
            parameter adjustments evidenced a human intellectual achievement, reducing the AI to the status of a mere
            tool.</li>
        <li><strong>The limit: Feng R. (2025):</strong> The Zhangjiagang court drew a welcome line by refusing
            protection where an image was produced from a single prompt, finding insufficient proof of an iterative
            creative process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>C. Regulating Training Data (Inputs)</h4>
    <p>China has no express text and data mining (TDM) exception in statute. Courts have, however, addressed the issue
        indirectly through the doctrine of temporary copying.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>WAP Search (2013) and Tianjin (2024):</strong> Judges have treated transient copying in RAM,
            technically necessary for processing and lacking independent economic value, as falling outside
            infringement. The reasoning could, in practice, help stabilise AI training pending legislative intervention.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The 2023 Interim Measures:</strong> This administrative instrument requires AI providers to ensure
            the legality of their data sources, effectively creating an <em>ex ante</em> compliance obligation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>II. Reform Projects and Political Direction: Towards Codified Innovation</h3>
    <p>Beijing is no longer content to let judges carry the load alone; it is preparing a fuller legislative
        architecture.</p>

    <h4>A. A Dedicated AI Law</h4>
    <p>Listed on the State Council legislative agenda, a future AI statute—of which academic drafts have circulated
        since 2024—could introduce a statutory TDM exception for machine learning, bringing China closer to
        jurisdictions such as Japan or Singapore. It may also codify protection for AI-assisted works.</p>

    <h4>B. Platform Accountability Takes Centre Stage</h4>
    <p>The “Ultraman” (2024) dispute illustrates a growing willingness to regulate AI providers directly. The Guangzhou
        court held a provider liable for failing to prevent its system from generating infringing images of the
        well-known character. Relying on the 2023 Interim Measures, the court articulated a duty of vigilance—including
        measures such as labelling and filtering—effectively turning AI platforms into front-line guardians of
        intellectual property.</p>

    <h3>III. Live Litigation: A Global Legal Laboratory</h3>
    <p>In only a few years, China has become a theatre for some of the most forward-leaning decisions on AI anywhere.
    </p>

    <h4>A. The Originality Battle</h4>
    <p>Recent decisions (including those associated with Changshu and Zhangjiagang) sketch a nuanced doctrine: copyright
        protection is not automatic. It must be earned through proof of substantial human input—iterations, adjustments,
        retouching. Where the user merely “presses a button”, the output risks remaining legally ownerless.</p>

    <h4>B. The Specialisation of Internet Courts</h4>
    <p>Following an October 2025 reform by the Supreme People’s Court, the role of China’s Internet Courts has been
        recalibrated. Relieved of mass, routine disputes, they are now positioned to focus on complex litigation
        involving data and algorithms. The shift signals a coming wave of case law on the ownership of datasets and
        algorithm-driven unfair competition.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>China is navigating with surprising agility. By using courts as legal sandboxes and regulating through
        administrative instruments (notably the 2023 Interim Measures), it has built an operational framework even
        before passing its flagship AI law. This hybrid model—protecting demonstrable human creative investment while
        imposing responsibility on platforms—may well influence Western lawmakers. China is no longer following
        international AI law; it is beginning to write it.</p>
