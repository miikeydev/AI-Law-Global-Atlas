    <h2>Australia Facing the AI Challenge: Between Anthropocentric Orthodoxy and Reformist Tentativeness</h2>
    <div class="abstract-box">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> As a Common Law jurisdiction, Australia paradoxically distinguishes itself from its
            British cousin
            through a resolutely conservative approach to Artificial Intelligence. While London protects
            computer-generated works, Canberra maintains a strict requirement for a human author, upheld by
            uncompromising case law. In 2026, Australian law finds itself at a crossroads: caught between the protection
            of
            creators and the economic necessity of innovation, the legislature is considering, not without friction,
            opening
            the way for a data mining exception.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I. The State of Black-Letter Law: The Human Author Fortress</h3>
    <p>The current Australian legal framework is characterized by notable conceptual rigidity. Unlike other
        jurisdictions attempting to adapt existing concepts, Australia reaffirms the exclusive centrality of the human
        being, creating de factolegal vacuums for autonomous creations.</p>

    <h4>A. The refusal to protect "machine-works"</h4>
    <p>The Copyright Act 1968 does not explicitly define "author," but case law has filled this silence with a
        restrictive interpretation. For a work to be protected, it must result from "independent intellectual effort"
        originating from a natural person.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Absence of a special regime:</strong> Unlike the United Kingdom (Section 9(3) CDPA 1988), Australia
            has
            no legal fiction allowing the authorship of a computer-generated work to be attributed to the investor or
            designer.</li>
        <li><strong>The immediate consequence:</strong> Any work autonomously generated by an AI, without substantial
            human
            creative intervention, falls into the public domain. Since moral rights are intrinsically linked to a
            natural person, AI is, by its very nature, excluded.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The impossible patentability of the "robot-inventor"</h4>
    <p>In industrial property, the Patents Act 1990 has been subject to strict judicial interpretation. Although the Act
        does not state it textually, it is now established following the Thaler jurisprudence (see below) that an AI
        cannot
        be designated as an inventor. The system mandates human ownership, forcing applicants to designate a natural
        person (developer or user) to hope for a grant, under penalty of rejection.</p>

    <h4>C. The vulnerability of training data (Inputs)</h4>
    <p>This is undoubtedly the most critical point for the AI industry. Australia recognizes neither sui generis
        database
        rights(having rejected the "sweat of the brow" doctrine) nor a specific Text and Data Mining (TDM)
        exception.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The "Fair Dealing" deadlock:</strong> Existing exceptions (Fair Dealing) are exhaustive and do not
            cover
            the massive training of models. In the absence of a license, the ingestion of protected content
            constitutes a major legal risk of infringement for developers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>II. Reform Projects and Political Trends: Toward an Economic Compromise?</h3>
    <p>Aware that this restrictive framework acts as a brake on innovation, the Australian government initiated a series
        of consultations between 2023 and 2025 aimed at modernizing copyright law without upsetting its
        fundamentals.</p>

    <h4>A. The controversial Productivity Commission recommendation (2025)</h4>
    <p>A major event was the publication of the Productivity Commission’s report on August 5, 2025. This document
        recommended the introduction of a Fair Dealing exception for TDM, specifically targeting AI training.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Objective:</strong> To provide legal certainty for local developers and prevent capital flight
            to more
            permissive jurisdictions.</li>
        <li><strong>The Cultural Rebellion:</strong> This proposal met with an immediate outcry from creative industries
            (ARIA,
            PPCA), who denounce a risk of "pillage" without compensation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. A consultative and "wait-and-see" approach</h4>
    <p>Despite the urgency, the government is biding its time. The creation of the Copyright and Artificial
        Intelligence Reference Group (CAIRG) in late 2023 illustrates this method: dialogue before legislation. While
        discussions are ongoing regarding dataset transparency and content labeling, no bill currently aims to recognize
        AI as an author or inventor. Australia seems to favor regulating usage (transparency, safety) rather than
        redefining intellectual property.</p>

    <h3>III. Current Case Law: The Confirmation of Orthodoxy</h3>
    <p>Recent Australian jurisprudence has acted as a deadbolt, closing doors that some lower court judges had
        attempted to push open.</p>

    <h4>A. The Thaler Saga: The end of the AI-inventor illusion</h4>
    <p>The case of Thaler v Commissioner of Patents remains the moment of truth for Australian patent law.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The breakthrough (2021):</strong> At first instance, Beach J boldly accepted that an AI (DABUS)
            could be an
            inventor, arguing that the law did not explicitly forbid it and that it served innovation.</li>
        <li><strong>The correction (2022):</strong> The Full Court of the Federal Court, ruling on appeal, unanimously
            overturned this position, reaffirming the "historical centrality" of the human inventor. The High
            Court’s refusal to hear the final appeal in November 2022 definitively sealed this case law: no human,
            no patent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The Telstra ruling (2010): A sword of Damocles over data</h4>
    <p>Although predating generative AI, the landmark ruling in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Phone Directories
        Company Pty Ltdcontinues to govern database protection. The Court held that a compilation (a phone directory)
        generated by an automated computer process, without independent human intellectual effort, is not protected by
        copyright.
        Current Impact: This jurisprudence confirms that raw AI outputs, much like automatically compiled
        training datasets, lack protection in Australia due to a lack of human originality.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Australia offers an example of a legal system resisting the "personification" of technology. By maintaining
        strict
        barriers to entry for copyright and patents, the courts have passed the ball back to the legislature. The
        challenge
        for the coming months lies in the government's ability to introduce a TDM exception balanced enough not to
        sacrifice its cultural industries on the altar of technological competition.</p>
