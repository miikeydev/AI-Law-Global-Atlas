    <h2>Brazil and the AI Challenge: Between Legal Vacuum and Praetorian Activism</h2>
    <div class="abstract-box">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> As Brazil asserts itself as a major digital player in Latin America, its
            intellectual property
            framework is entering an unprecedented period of turbulence. Torn between strict anthropocentric legislation
            and the economic reality of generative models, Brazilian law oscillates between a rigid application of
            traditional principles and the emergence of bold reform projects. This is an analysis of a system where,
            while
            awaiting the legislator, the judges of the State of Santa Catarina are sketching the first lines of
            regulation
            through usage.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I. The State of Black-Letter Law: Human Authorship Orthodoxy vs. the "Gray Zone"</h3>
    <p>Brazilian substantive law is characterized by a hermetic refusal to recognize AI as a legal subject, creating a
        growing rift with technological practices.</p>

    <h4>A. The "Natural Person" deadlock</h4>
    <p>Brazilian copyright law is unequivocal. Law No. 9,610/1998 (Article 11) and the Constitution enshrine the
        principle that "the author is the natural person who creates the work." This provision de facto excludes
        autonomously generated AI creations from the scope of protection.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No protection for autonomous works:</strong> In the absence of identifiable human creative
            intervention, the
            work falls into the public domain. If AI is merely a tool steered by a human, protection is possible, but
            the degree of intervention required remains a zone of jurisprudential uncertainty.</li>
        <li><strong>Rejection of the non-human inventor:</strong> Regarding patents, the Industrial Property Law No.
            9,279/1996 (LPI)requires the applicant to be a person. The Brazilian Patent and Trademark Office
            (INPI) clarified its doctrine in a 2022 opinion following the DABUS case, confirming the impossibility
            of naming an AI as an inventor. A human must be designated, even if they only configured the
            machine—a legal fiction that weakens the integrity of the patent system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The vulnerability of training data (Inputs)</h4>
    <p>It is in the realm of data that the Brazilian framework proves most deficient compared to European standards.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Absence of sui generis rights:</strong> Unlike the EU, Brazil does not protect the investment in
            non-original
            databases. Only the creative structure is covered by copyright. Raw data and non-original datasets are
            therefore exposed to scraping, barring complex recourse to unfair competition law.</li>
        <li><strong>Theoretical illegality of training:</strong> Brazil possesses neither a Text and Data Mining (TDM)
            exception
            nor a "Fair Use" doctrine. Consequently, the massive ingestion of protected works to train models
            constitutes, according to the Ministry of Culture, a multiple violation of copyright (reproduction and
            adaptation). This legal insecurity places AI developers in a state of permanent risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>II. Reform Projects and Political Trends: A Disruptive Legislation?</h3>
    <p>Aware of these impasses, the Brazilian legislator launched a major offensive in 2023-2024, seeking to position
        the country at the forefront of regulation.</p>

    <h4>A. Bill No. 2338/2023: Towards a new social pact for creation</h4>
    <p>Approved by the Senate on December 10, 2024, this ambitious text (the "Marco Legal" or Legal Framework)
        proposes an innovative balance between protection and innovation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Transparency and Opt-out:</strong> The bill requires AI providers to declare the protected works
            used for
            training. Furthermore, it establishes an opt-out right for authors, returning control over the use of their
            creations to them.</li>
        <li><strong>Remuneration and Sandboxes:</strong> The text provides for a supervised negotiation environment to
            guarantee remuneration for rights holders, calculated based on the economic and competitive impact of
            the AI.</li>
        <li><strong>Structured Exceptions:</strong> A data mining exception is introduced but limited to non-commercial
            purposes (research, journalism)—a point of friction with the industry, which demands more flexibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. Bill No. 303/2024: Bold controversy on patents</h4>
    <p>This text, still under discussion in the Chamber of Deputies (as of the October 2024 report), attempts a hybrid
        approach to inventiveness.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Modulated Protection:</strong> While maintaining the requirement for a human inventor, the bill
            proposes to
            drastically reduce the patent term (to 3 or 5 years) when AI has played a predominant role.</li>
        <li><strong>Doctrinal Criticism:</strong> This proposal raises serious concerns regarding its compliance with
            the TRIPS
            Agreement(which mandates a 20-year protection term) and risks creating legal uncertainty regarding
            the qualification of the AI’s role.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>III. Current Litigation: Santa Catarina as a Judicial Laboratory</h3>
    <p>In the absence of promulgated law, the courts, particularly those of the State of Santa Catarina (TJSC),have
        taken the initiative to fill legal gaps with bold decisions.</p>

    <h4>A. The music royalties case (TJSC, August 2025)</h4>
    <p>In a resounding preliminary ruling opposing ECAD (the central collection bureau) and a theme park, the Santa
        Catarina Court of Justice ruled that the public performance of AI-generated music is subject to the payment of
        copyright royalties.
        Doctrinal Significance: The judge prioritized the protection of economic use over the
        identification of the author. Even without an identified human behind the creation, commercial
        exploitation generates a remuneration obligation. This is a de facto recognition of the proprietary
        value of artificial works.</p>

    <h4>B. The Meta / ANPD case (TJSC, March 2025)</h4>
    <p>This litigation illustrates the intersection between intellectual property and personal data. While the Public
        Prosecutor sought the suspension of Meta’s AI training (Llama) on user data, the TJSC deferred to the
        administrative decision of the ANPD (National Data Protection Authority).
        Analysis: In July 2023, the ANPD had already ordered a halt to this processing. This case
        demonstrates that, failing an effective lever in copyright law, the regulation of training data currently flows
        through Privacy channels, acting as an emergency brake against massive scraping.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Brazil stands at a crossroads. Its black-letter law, frozen in a classic humanist conception, no longer meets the
        challenges of generative AI. However, the current dynamic is one of vigorous reclamation: by the judiciary,
        which does not hesitate to tax AI usage, and by the legislator, who is sketching a transparent and remunerative
        regulatory model with Bill 2338. If these reforms succeed, Brazil could offer a credible alternative model to
        the
        European and American approaches.</p>
