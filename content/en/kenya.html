    <h2>AI in Kenya: Between Anthropocentric Orthodoxy and the Regulatory Vanguard</h2>

    <h3>I. The State of Black-Letter Law: An Anthropocentric Orthodoxy</h3>
    <p>The current Kenyan legal framework, structured by the Copyright Act (Cap. 130) and the Industrial Property
        Act of 2001, rests on an unshakeable dogma: intellectual property is an emanation of human genius. However,
        Kenya distinguishes itself through a textual flexibility inherited from the British model.</p>

    <h4>A. The "Natural Person" Deadlock and the "Arranger" Exception</h4>
    <p>Kenyan copyright law conditions protection on the existence of an original human creation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Arranger Rule:</strong> For computer-generated works, the law provides a pragmatic legal
            fiction: the
            author is "the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work are
            undertaken." This mechanism allows an AI production to be linked to a human (designer or user),
            provided they exercised significant control.</li>
        <li><strong>The "Sweat of the Brow" Criterion:</strong> Unlike French civil law, which requires the "stamp of
            the
            author's personality," Kenyan originality is assessed based on the "sufficient effort" invested. Yet,
            this threshold remains unreachable for a machine alone; without human intervention, a creation is
            deemed to lack originality and falls into the public domain.</li>
        <li><strong>The Refusal of the "Robot-Inventor":</strong> In patent law, the 2001 Act requires an inventor who
            has
            "actually conceived the invention." Kenya follows a strictly conservative approach here, refusing to
            recognize legal personhood for a machine, aligning with the global rejection seen in the DABUS case.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. Databases and Algorithms: Protection by Default</h4>
    <p>Unlike the European Union, Kenya does not recognize sui generis rights for databases.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Protection through Compilation:</strong> A dataset is only protected if it constitutes an original
            compilation
            (selection or arrangement of data) requiring non-trivial intellectual labor. Raw data and facts remain
            free for appropriation.</li>
        <li><strong>The TDM Blind Spot:</strong> Substantive law is silent on the legality of data scraping for model
            training. In
            the absence of an explicit Text and Data Mining (TDM) exception, the massive use of protected
            works as algorithmic "fuel" constitutes a major legal risk for local developers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>II. Reform Projects and Political Trends: The 2030 Horizon</h3>
    <p>Aware of the gaps in its 2001 framework, the Kenyan government launched its National AI Strategy
        (2025–2030) in March 2025, setting the stage for profound modernization.</p>

    <h4>A. Clarifying the Status of Generative AI</h4>
    <p>The Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) and the Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI) are
        collaborating on guidelines to frame the ownership of hybrid works. The ambition is two-fold:
        1. To confirm the exclusion of work components produced autonomously by an AI.
        2. To legitimize AI assistance by precisely defining the required level of human intervention (prompt
        selection, final editing).</p>

    <h4>B. The Remuneration and Transparency Project</h4>
    <p>An amendment to the Copyright Act is under review to resolve the machine learning dilemma. Two paths are
        being explored: the introduction of a TDM exception for research purposes, or the creation of a right to
        remuneration for authors whose catalogs feed AI models. This second option, supported by the music sector,
        signals a desire to protect the economic value of cultural heritage against global Tech giants.</p>

    <h4>C. The Rise of Ethical Regulation</h4>
    <p>While awaiting formal legislation, the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) released a draft AI Code of
        Conduct in April 2024. Although non-binding, this text promotes the traceability of training data and the
        documentation of algorithms, encouraging responsible self-regulation.</p>

    <h3>III. Current Litigation: The "Aryeh Movement" Jurisprudence</h3>
    <p>While the legislator bides its time, the Kenyan Copyright Tribunal took a stand in 2025 with a historic
        landmark decision.</p>

    <h4>A. Aryeh Movement Ltd v. Cynthia Beldina Akoth Okello (2025)</h4>
    <p>On September 26, 2025, the Tribunal rendered a fundamental judgment (COPTA/E001/2025) concerning
        literary works illustrated by AI.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Ruling:</strong> The Tribunal solemnly affirmed that a work produced autonomously by an AI is
            excluded from all protection.</li>
        <li><strong>The Reasoning:</strong> In the absence of proof of a substantial original contribution from the
            human
            user, the AI cannot be considered an author. This decision constitutes the country's first
            operational judicial framework, harmonizing Kenyan law with U.S. (Thaler v. Perlmutter) and
            European standards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. Jurisprudential Silence and Data Privacy</h4>
    <p>Despite this breakthrough, Kenyan litigation remains silent on algorithmic patentability and platform liability
        for AI-generated infringement. However, attention is shifting toward personal data: the Kenyan firm Sama, a
        global hub for data annotation, has highlighted the ethical and contractual risks associated with the massive
        processing of content to train models like ChatGPT.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion: A Law in the Making</h3>
    <p>Kenya is navigating between rigor and adaptation. While the Aryeh Movement case secures the principle of the
        human author, the country still lacks a precise legislative framework for data scraping and the protection of
        trained models.
        The future of IP law in Kenya will depend on the state's ability to transform its strategic visions into binding
        norms. The stakes are high: preserving the nation's cultural sovereignty while providing the "Silicon Savannah"
        with the legal certainty necessary to become an African leader in Artificial Intelligence. The upcoming
        directives from KECOBO will be a decisive signal for investors and creators alike.</p>
