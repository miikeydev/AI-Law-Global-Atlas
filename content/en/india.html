    <h2>India, a Digital Giant with Feet of Legal Clay: AI vs. the Intellectual Property Challenge</h2>
    <div class="abstract-box">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A global software powerhouse and a prime destination for technological outsourcing,
            India now
            finds itself facing a paradoxical legal vacuum. While its AI ecosystem is exploding, its intellectual
            property
            framework, inherited from the 20th century, remains closed to autonomous creations. Between administrative
            refusals to recognize "creative AI" and a lack of training data regulation, this is an analysis of a system
            attempting to bridge its gaps through an ambitious but still programmatic national strategy.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I. The State of Black-Letter Law: The Anthropocentric Heritage</h3>
    <p>Indian Intellectual Property (IP) law, while robust for traditional creations, is clashing head-on with the
        reality of
        generative AI. The current legislative framework maintains a strict requirement for human intervention, creating
        de facto"no-man's lands" for algorithmic productions.</p>

    <h4>A. The human author monopoly</h4>
    <p>The Copyright Act, 1957 has not been amended for the AI era. Both doctrine and administrative practice
        confirm that only a human being can be qualified as an "author."</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Exclusion of autonomous works:</strong> Creations generated automatically by an AI, without
            substantial
            human supervision, lack protection. They fall into the public domain from the moment of their
            creation.</li>
        <li><strong>The "hybrid" gray zone:</strong> If a human intervenes in selection or editing, protection is
            possible.
            However, the threshold of originality required remains blurred, leaving a significant margin of
            uncertainty for assisted works.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The impossible machine-invention</h4>
    <p>The Patents Act, 1970 requires that an invention result from a "human inventive step."</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Refusal of the AI-inventor:</strong> AI-generated inventions are excluded from patentability. India
            aligns here
            with the international majority (USA, Europe), refusing to personify the machine within the inventive
            process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>C. Data vulnerability (Inputs)</h4>
    <p>This is the "Achilles' heel" of the Indian system. Unlike Europe, India does not possess sui generis database
        rights.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Indirect and limited protection:</strong> Datasets are protected by copyright only if they
            demonstrate
            originality in their selection and arrangement. Raw data compilations, essential for training models,
            lack specific protection unless developers resort to contracts or trade secrets.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of Scraping Regulation:</strong> There is no specific regulation governing web scraping for AI
            training,
            leaving stakeholders in a state of total legal insecurity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>II. Reform Projects and Political Trends: A Strategy without a Law</h3>
    <p>Aware of this lag, India is multiplying its strategic initiatives but is struggling to translate them into
        binding
        norms.</p>

    <h4>A. NITI Aayog’s National Strategy</h4>
    <p>The government’s premier think tank, NITI Aayog, published its "National Strategy for AI" (updated in 2023),
        setting the milestones for ethical and responsible development.
        Scope: While this document frames Indian ambitions, it does not have the force of law. No
        specific legislation regarding copyright for AI creations has yet been adopted based on these
        recommendations.</p>

    <h4>B. Toward global technological regulation?</h4>
    <p>Two texts currently under discussion could indirectly impact IP:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023:</strong> This Act regulates the use of
            personal data,
            effectively impacting training datasets containing identifiable information.</li>
        <li><strong>The AI-Enabled Technologies Bill (under discussion since 2024):</strong> This project aims to
            establish
            transparency and accountability for algorithms. While not yet adopted, it marks a shift toward
            regulating the tool rather than redefining ownership.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>III. Current Litigation: The Administration as Peacekeeper</h3>
    <p>In the absence of established case law from the High Courts, the administration is currently setting the "red
        lines."</p>

    <h4>A. The Copyright Office refusal (IBM Watson case, 2024-2025)</h4>
    <p>In a significant administrative decision, the Indian Copyright Office refused a registration application for a
        work generated by the IBM Watson AI.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This decision administratively confirms the necessity of a human author. It
            sends a clear
            signal to creators: India will not be a laboratory for "electronic personhood."</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. Classic commercial litigation</h4>
    <p>Recent disputes (2023–2025) concerning scraping and reverse engineering are being settled based on contract
        law and classic copyright principles. The courts have not yet developed an autonomous theory for AI models or
        datasets, applying "old remedies to new ills."</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>India is currently "flying by sight." Its legal framework, frozen in a traditional conception of creation, leaves
        AI
        in a "no-man’s land" that is increasingly concerning for investors. While the national strategy displays strong
        ambition, the lack of concrete legislative reform regarding the ownership of data and algorithms maintains a
        legal insecurity that only rapid intervention by the Parliament of India can resolve.</p>
