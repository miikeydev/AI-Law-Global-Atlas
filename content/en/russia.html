    <h2>Artificial Intelligence in Russia: Between Dogmatic Rigidity and Praetorian Pragmatism</h2>
    <div class="abstract-box">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Like other major technological powers, the Russian Federation stands at a legal
            crossroads. While
            its Civil Code remains anchored in a humanist conception of creation, the country is witnessing the
            emergence
            of bold jurisprudence on deepfakes and structural reform projects. Between the rejection of the
            "AI-inventor"
            and the sanctification of "AI-as-a-tool," this is an analysis of a legal system in transition, seeking to
            reconcile
            the protection of creators with digital sovereignty.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I. The State of Black-Letter Law: The Bulwark of Legal Anthropocentrism</h3>
    <p>The current Russian legal framework, governed primarily by Part IV of the Civil Code, rests on an immutable
        dogma: creation is an exclusively human act. This "instrumental" approach reduces AI to the status of a tool,
        refusing any legal autonomy to the machine.</p>

    <h4>A. The "Natural Person" deadlock</h4>
    <p>In copyright law, Article 1257 of the Civil Code is explicit: the author is the "citizen whose creative labor has
        produced the work." This definition de jure excludes any original ownership for an AI. Lacking its own will, the
        machine cannot claim rights, and purely autonomous productions theoretically fall into the public domain.
        However, Russian doctrine recognizes the validity of hybrid works. As long as a human makes creative choices
        (drafting complex prompts, editing, selection), they assume the status of the author. The boundary remains
        porous, nonetheless, as the legislator has not defined the threshold for "creative contribution."</p>

    <h4>B. The impasse of autonomous patentability</h4>
    <p>Patent law follows an identical logic. Article 1347 of the Civil Code reserves the status of "inventor" for a
        natural person. The practice of Rospatent (the Russian Patent Office) crystallized this position in 2020 by
        dismissing an application that designated an AI as the inventor. In line with the international consensus seen
        in
        the Thaler case, Russia refuses to personify algorithmic innovation. While computer-implemented inventions
        are patentable (Art. 1350), they must imperatively be linked to a human inventor.</p>

    <h4>C. Robust protection for "Inputs": The database model</h4>
    <p>While the status of outputs (creations) is precarious, inputs (data) benefit from a precise framework. Since
        2008, Russia has possessed a sui generis database producer right (Art. 1334), modeled after the European
        system. Any maker who has made a substantial investment (a presumption set at 10,000 elements) holds an
        exclusive right of extraction. This regime provides legal certainty for the data repositories essential to AI,
        independent of any creative originality.</p>

    <h3>II. Reform Projects and Political Trends: Toward Normative Flexibility</h3>
    <p>Aware of the law's shortcomings regarding generative AI, the State Duma launched several major legislative
        projects between May and October 2025.</p>

    <h4>A. Legislative recognition of the "User-Author"</h4>
    <p>A draft amendment to Article 1259 of the Civil Code is under consideration for late 2025. Its ambition is to fill
        the legal vacuum surrounding works created with the help of neural networks. The goal is to enshrine the role of
        the human user as the "project lead" (maître d'œuvre), legally attributing authorship of the results to them.
        This
        project would also introduce legal definitions for AI and deepfakes, marking a drive toward the technical
        normalization of the law.</p>

    <h4>B. Accelerating "Machine Learning" patentability</h4>
    <p>On the industrial front, a bill introduced on May 21, 2025, aims to ensure that recourse to machine learning does
        not constitute an obstacle to patentability. By amending Articles 1350 et seq., the legislator wishes to remove
        any ambiguity regarding the admissibility of inventions involving deep learning, treating them as classic
        technical inventions.</p>

    <h4>C. Pressure from creative industries</h4>
    <p>In 2025, the National Federation of the Music Industry (NFMI) advocated for stricter revenue regulation. It
        specifically proposes excluding 100% AI-generated content from royalty calculations and creating a specific
        right to protect the voice and image of artists against unauthorized synthesis. This trend reflects a desire to
        protect the economic value of human labor against the proliferation of automated content.</p>

    <h3>III. Current Litigation: The "Keanu Reeves" Case as a Compass</h3>
    <p>In the absence of finalized reforms, Russian courts have taken the lead through a constructive interpretation of
        existing texts.</p>

    <h4>A. Landmark ruling of the Intellectual Property Court (SIP)</h4>
    <p>The "Keanu Reeves Deepfake" case (2023–2024) constitutes the first major jurisprudential milestone.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Facts:</strong> An advertising video using a face synthesized by deepfake was reused without
            authorization. The infringer argued there was no protection due to the use of AI.</li>
        <li><strong>The Decision:</strong> The Moscow Arbitration Court, confirmed by the SIP Court on November 8, 2024,
            ruled that the video fell under copyright protection.</li>
        <li><strong>The Reasoning:</strong> The judges held that AI was merely an "additional processing tool," with the
            originality residing in the human script and staging. This decision validates the instrumental approach
            and secures investments in AI-manipulated content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B. The gray areas: Training data and Text Mining</h4>
    <p>To date, no Russian litigation has settled the question of the legality of massive data extraction (Text and Data
        Mining) for AI training. Unlike the EU, Russia has no specific exception. The risk of infringement for
        unauthorized reproduction remains a "Sword of Damocles" for developers, although doctrine is exploring the
        theory of "technical copying" without independent economic value to attempt to legitimize these practices.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion: A Status Quo in Transition</h3>
    <p>The Russian AI legal landscape is characterized by tension between the stability of the Civil Code and the
        urgency of innovation. While case law has already tilted in favor of protecting assisted works, the legislator
        has
        yet to clarify the status of training data. The national strategy through 2030 promises a "flexible" framework;
        it
        remains to be seen whether this flexibility can preserve authors' rights while allowing for the birth of a
        sovereign
        technological ecosystem.</p>
